	 * Stream function is an abstract function allowing writing many

	 * The stream function accepts three parameter:
	 *
	 *   1. state. It is usually the last returned value from function but
	 *      it may be {@link Stream.END} when {@link Stream.CONTINUE} was
	 *      returned and there was no more elements.
	 *   1. input. It is valid only if first argument is
	 *      {@link Stream.CONTINUE}
	 *   1. output. It is valid only if result is Stream.YIELD
	 *
	 * It may return one of 3 results:
	 *
	 *   1. {@link Stream.YIELD}. It means that value was yielded and can
	 *      be passed to outgoing iterator.
	 *   1. {@link Stream.CONTINUE}. It means that the function needs to be
	 *      called with next element or with {@link Stream.END} if it is
	 *      end of stream). If the state element was Stream.END during the
	 *      current iteration function ''must not'' return {@link Stream.CONTINUE}
	 *   1. Stream.END. It means that the last argument was yielded.
	 *
	 * If the function yields the value immediately then the returning iterator
	 * is {@link Iterator.valid} and points to this value as well as in case when the
	 * parent iterator is {@link Iterator.valid} and function yields
	 * after consuming 1 input. In other case returned iterator is invalid.
	 *
	 * Note: In {@link Iterator} implementation: if iterator is
	 *    {@link Iterator.valid} the current value should be fed
	 *    immediately to function if during initial call function returns
	 *    {@link Stream.CONTINUE}. The parent iterator cannot be used before
	 *    the functions return {@link Stream.END} afterwards it points on the
	 *    last element consumed.
